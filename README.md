Welcome to our web-based educational block-based programming environment for Arduino! This tool is designed to introduce K-12 students to the world of programming and electronics using the popular Arduino platform BlocklyDuino. Below are instructions on how to start the tool and an overview of its features:

## Getting Started:

1. Ensure you have a compatible web browser installed (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.).
2. Run this comment on terminal: python arduino_web_server.py so you can run a mini webserver that uses the Arduino IDE.
3. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ on browser.
4. Start exploring.

### Features

* Programming Arduino with visually drag and drop code blocks
* Different sounds for different blocks (Everytime a block is placed on the workspace, a sound is played(click.mp3). A different sound is played for the following block: ![Example Image](block.jpg))
* Generate fully compatible Arduino source code
* Upload code to Arduino board

### Usage
1. Open browser to BlocklyDuino, drag and drop blocks to make an Arduino program
2. Select the Arduino tab and press the Upload button. (press the Reset button to upload an empty program)
