This tool is designed to introduce beginners, including K-12 students, to the world of programming and electronics using the popular Arduino platform. Below are instructions on how to start the tool and an overview of its features:

## Getting Started:

1. Ensure you have a compatible web browser installed (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.).
2. Invoke this command from the BlocklyDuino root folder: python arduino_web_server.py so you can run a mini webserver that uses the Arduino IDE.
3. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080/.
4. Start exploring and creating your own Arduino projects!

### Features

* Programming Arduino with visually drag and drop code blocks
* Different sounds for different blocks ()
* Generate fully compatible Arduino source code
* Upload code to Arduino board

### Usage
